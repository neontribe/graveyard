'''This class is designed to be a simplification of Ansible's notably
undocumented API. It also has some explanation of the API used, in the hope of
making days of trawling through Ansible's source code to work out what the heck
was going on worthwhile.

The term "Ansible" is a reference to a communication medium in a Sci-Fi novel
that can use faster-than-light methods to send messages. Tachyons are
unproven theoratical particles that can supposedly exceed the speed of light. So
aren't we clever.
